# Supply and Demand Market Equilibrium Analysis

A Python-based visualization tool for analyzing market equilibrium, government interventions, and price elasticity using supply and demand curves.

## 📊 Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental microeconomic concepts through interactive visualizations:
- Market equilibrium analysis
- Supply and demand shifts
- Government policy impacts (price floors and ceilings)
- Elasticity comparisons

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** - numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** - data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** - interactive analysis

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

### Running the Analysis
```bash
jupyter notebook supply_demand_analysis.ipynb
```

## 📈 Key Features

1. **Basic Equilibrium** - Find where supply meets demand
2. **Market Shifts** - Visualize demand and supply curve movements
3. **Price Controls** - Analyze surpluses (price floors) and shortages (price ceilings)
4. **Elasticity Analysis** - Compare inelastic vs elastic demand curves

## 💡 Key Insights

- Price floors create market surpluses (e.g., unemployment from minimum wage)
- Price ceilings create shortages (e.g., housing shortages from rent control)
- Elasticity determines how quantity responds to price changes

## 🔮 Future Extensions

- [ ] Tax incidence analysis
- [ ] Consumer/producer surplus calculations
- [ ] Deadweight loss visualization
- [ ] Interactive dashboard with Plotly
